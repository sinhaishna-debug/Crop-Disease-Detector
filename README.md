# 🌱 Crop Disease Detector with Weather-Based Early Warning

## 📌 Overview
This project integrates image-based CNN disease detection with weather-based risk prediction to provide early warning alerts for crop diseases. The system combines deep learning and machine learning techniques to provide intelligent agricultural insights.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Crop diseases and climatic variations cause large-scale agricultural losses. Farmers lack accessible tools to:
- Detect diseases at an early stage
- Predict climate-based disease risks
- Take preventive action based on real-time data

---

## 🚀 Proposed Solution
We propose a hybrid AI system combining:

- 🌿 CNN-based leaf disease classification  
- 🌦 Weather-driven disease risk modeling (Random Forest / XGBoost)  
- 📊 Integrated early warning dashboard  

The system analyzes both visual and environmental parameters to provide a more accurate prediction.
