# 🌱 Crop Disease Detector with Weather-Based Early Warning

## 📌 Overview
This project integrates image-based CNN disease detection with weather-based risk prediction to provide early warning alerts for crop diseases.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Crop diseases and climatic variations cause large-scale agricultural losses. Farmers lack accessible tools to detect diseases early or predict climate-based risks.

## 🚀 Proposed Solution
We propose a hybrid ML system combining:
- CNN-based leaf disease classification
- Weather-driven disease risk modeling (Random Forest/XGBoost)
- Integrated early warning dashboard

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- XGBoost / Random Forest
- Flask (for web interface)
- PlantVillage Dataset

## 📊 Features
- Upload leaf image for disease detection
- Input climate parameters (humidity, temperature, rainfall)
- Hybrid risk score prediction
- Dashboard visualization

## 📂 Project Structure
See folder breakdown in repository.

## 📈 Future Scope
- Mobile app deployment
- IoT integration
- Region-specific training
